Platforms are being developed to aid data discovery.

Data discovery is a really important part of data science. Often companies hold data across multiple sources and systems. Finding that different sources and linking them together takes up large portions of a data scientists time. So it is understandable why people would want to make the prices easier.

Lots of big tech firms have been building platforms to help make this process more efficient. Some have open sourced them including [Amundsen](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/) from Lyft and Apaches [Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org/#/), and [DataHub](https://linkedin.github.io/datahub/) from Linked-in.

It seems the combine natural language search (based on elastic search mostly) with easily accessible data on how data links together, how and when it has been used, and who owns the data.

I'm not sure how easy it would be to integrate these systems in a new company - datasets are often spread across many systems including multiple clouds and various SaaS systems.
