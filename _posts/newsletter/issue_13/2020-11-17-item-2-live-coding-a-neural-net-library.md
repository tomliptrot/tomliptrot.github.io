Joel Grus live codes a neural network library in Python. 

Really useful to see this - both for coding tips and understanding how neural networks work. He builds a basic library including all fo the key elements of a neural network ad then shows how to use the network to solve a few toy problems.

It's an impressive feat and really demonstrates a deep level of understanding. If you can live code something complex and teach it well you must really know what is going on.

Its also good to see somebody actually coding, along with all the mistakes everybody makes and how he uses the tools (VS code, mypy, extensive use of type hints). You don't get this in standard static tutorials or blog posts. I'd argue you will learn more form watching this video than many online courses win teach a sanitised version of the wold.
