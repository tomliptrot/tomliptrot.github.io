There are 28 privately held ML, AI and data companies, that are nearing IPO. Their total valuation is around $119B.

US investor [Matt Turk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/turck/) has put together a  [list](https://mattturck.com/emergingmad/) of these so-called unicorns that compliments his [other list](https://mattturck.com/madindex/) of public traded firms.  They seem to split into three main groups:

- Databases (eg [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), [Redis](https://redislabs.com/), [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/))
- AI platforms  ([Databricks](https://databricks.com/), [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com/), [Datarobot](https://www.datarobot.com/))
- Process Automation ([Celonis](https://www.celonis.com/), [Hypersciene](https://hyperscience.com/), [Instabase](https://instabase.com/?ib=v2))

Many of these companies do not use AI and ML in their products: they make tools to make it easier to use for other businesses - selling picks and shovels in a gold rush. Many are overlapping and competing and it will be interesting to see which take off in a huge way and which disappear over the next few years.

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** This list shows where companies have been successful so far in using AI and ML. It's mostly in building tools.
