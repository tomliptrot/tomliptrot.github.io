## 1. New EU AI laws

![New EU AI laws](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_18/tingey-injury-law-firm-DZpc4UY8ZtY-unsplash.jpeg)

The European Union has published a proposal for a new set of laws regulating the use of artificial intelligence.

The [proposal](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-european-approach-artificial-intelligence) defines levels of risk for various applications of this technology.  The highest level of risk ("unacceptable risk") includes social scoring by governments, exploitation of the vulnerabilities of children, use of subliminal techniques, and remote biometric identification. Under the proposal, these applications of AI would be banned. 

The next level down ("high risk"), which would be heavily regulated, includes specific uses in education, recruitment, law enforcement and border control. Regulation here would cover ethics, data quality, documentation, transparency and accuracy.  At this stage details are fairly sparse.

I welcome the proposals and for the most part they seem appropriate and much needed. However, I expect debate over this to rage for the next decade. The technology is rapidly developing and regulation will struggle to keep up. 

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** On regulation, where the EU leads, others tend to follow. It's early days: expect this to run and run.

## 2. Microsoft buys $20bn speech recognition firm

![Microsoft buys $20bn speech recognition firm](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_18/laith-abushaar-obcO4zhwDfU-unsplash.jpeg)

Microsoft has announced it will buy the speech recognition firm Nuance Communications for $20bn.

Nuance has been around since the 90s and has done a range of things, but is best known for its speech recognition technology. The company partnered with Apple to create the Siri virtual assistant and its Dragon speech recognition system is widely used in healthcare.

The [press release](https://news.microsoft.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance/) from Microsoft emphasised the access the company has in the healthcare market. Nuance systems are used in 77% of US hospitals. However, the aquisition will also allow access to Nuance's expertise in using a machine learning system at scale in production.

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:**  $20bn is a lot - this shows how important speech is likely to become.

## 3. What's wrong with MLops

![What's wrong with MLops](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_18/michal-matlon-4ApmfdVo32Q-unsplash.jpeg)

MLOps is the practice of building and maintaining production machine learning systems. It's new, and it's not all going well.

In a recent [newsletter](https://laszlo.substack.com/p/whats-wrong-with-mlops) Laszlo Sragner wrote about what is wrong on the nascent field. It's a bit of a rant, and I liked it.

ML is still in its infancy and is plagued by hype. Lots of people are trying to sell complete 'solutions' to enterprise customers. Often these are bound to fail. Turn-key, fully repeatable solutions do not exist yet.

People hear about a jazzy new algorithm or some big data solution that Google has used and try and shoehorn it into the enterprise project they are working on that has 1,000 data-points. Following fashion and fads is easier than thinking deeply about the costs and benefits of various approaches.

When deciding what algorithm/database/platform/stack to use, don't base your decision on what you read about in a research paper last week, base it on the parameters of your problem. If you don't know what the parameters of your problem are yet, spend some time working them out first.

Most of the problems of ML are just engineering problems; we have methods and approaches, developed over decades, that solve those. There are new problems in MLOps but many have simple solutions. It's good to hear the voice of reason.

üõéÔ∏è  **Why this matters:** MLOps is certainly important but beware of the hype mongers and use common sense.

## 4. First, deploy your model

![First, deploy your model](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_18/birmingham-museums-trust-9GSGllMJCeA-unsplash.jpeg)

Should the first step in a machine learning project be to build a production system?

Deploying early solves a multitude of problems [according](https://www.bodyworkml.com/posts/scikit-learn-meet-production) to Bodywork ML. It forces you to think about and solve deployment issues early and encourages best practices at a stage when they are easy to implement.

This sort of approach (described as the Tracer Bullet approach in the excellent [Pragmatic Progammer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-Andrew-Hunt/dp/020161622X) book) is popular in agile programming and allows iterative improvement to a basic system.

I like the thinking behind this approach, but must say I don't always follow it. I tend to find that I need a different mindset for MLOps vs data exploration. Building a production system given a limited understanding of the data and domain can lock you into an initial conception of the problem. I like to keep initial data exploration and model building as lightweight as possible until I really understand both the data and solution. However, getting something deployed and tested in reality early is certainly a good idea.

üõéÔ∏è**Why this matters:** Model deployment can be tricky, thinking about it upfront can make things easier later.

## 5. What is attention?

![What is attention?](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_18/chuttersnap-gDDas5_ALRw-unsplash.jpeg)

Why do some things grab our attention while we ignore others? What is going on in our brains? 

A recent [article](https://thegradient.pub/attention-in-human-brain-and-its-applications-in-ml/) by AI/ML researcher Ekrem Aksoy attempts to describe the latest thinking in both neuroscience and machine learning.

Attention is a concept that has been successfully used in machine learning \(see the seminal paper "[Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)"). In natural language processing it is used to emphasise parts of language that are salient in the understanding of the text. It has also been applied successfully in computer vision.

Attention is how the brain selects a subset of information it perceives as being particularly important. This mechanism is still not completely understood in the brain, but clues as to how it works could be useful in inspiring the next generation of ML models.

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** Attention is a key concept in ML, inspired by the brain.
