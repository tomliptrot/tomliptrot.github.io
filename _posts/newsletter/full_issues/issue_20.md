## 1. ARGH! AI is going to kill us all!

The dinosaurs were killed-off by an asteroid. We'll probably be killed-off by ourselves.

There is a burgeoning tradition of prophecies by clever rich white men about the long term dangers of 'super-intelligent' AI. A new [book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B082SXGJYC/) on the topic has now been added by  Oxford philosopher Toby Ord and nicely [reviewed](https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/how-to-think-about-existential-and-immediate-risks-by-daron-acemoglu-2021-05) by Daron Acemoglu.

The idea goes like this: we've power not wisdom, we've developed technology without the ability to control it. We should minimise existential risk whatever the cost. We should focus a large amount of current resources on avoiding the fate of the dinosaurs. The greatest threat is AI.

I don't buy it. Worrying about super intelligent AI taking over is (as Andrew Ng said) like worrying about overpopulation on Mars. We're not there yet.

What we should be worrying about is the impact existing AI + human chimeras and their corporate bodies are having on the world today. Inequality, environmental damage, misinformation and control are all big present problems that would be more fruitful to focus on. Initiatives such as the EU's proposed AI regulation are likely to have more positive impact than philosophical warbling (much as I enjoy philosophical warbling).

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** AI already runs the world.

## 2. The really open NLP fightback

![The really open NLP fightback](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_20/sid-balachandran-hXttDVCwyRA-unsplash.jpeg)

Large language models have become the property of big tech firms. Open science is starting to fight back.

Large language models like GPT-3 have shown advanced performance across a range of language tasks. Howver, the ironically named Open AI recently signed an exclusive deal with Microsoft over access to its GPT-3 model.Other tech fimrs are developing thier own closed models.

These models are very effective, but it is difficult for researchers to assess how they perform with respect to ethical considerations such as biases including racism, sexism and abusive ideas.

NLP startup Hugging Face is now [coordinating](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/en/#!index.md) a project to build a set of large multilingual language models that are fully open and available for researchers to study. 

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** Science and software work best when they are open.

## 3. How to learn MLOps

![How to learn MLOps](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_20/tim-mossholder-WE_Kv_ZB1l0-unsplash.jpeg)

Coursera and Andrew Ng have launched a new course on machine learning engineering for production or MLOps.

It is made up of four sub-courses. Some topics covered include:

 - Data pipelines
 - Feature engineering
 - Data labelling
 - Model serving and scaling
 - Model monitoring

I've enjoyed some of Prof Ngs other courses, so this promises to be good as well. I think the difficulty will be keeping it up-to-date and also relevant for the Googles of the world alongside the non-Googles of the world. If anybody takes the course, please let me know what you think.

It varies from person to person, but I know I tend to learn better from doing than a course like this. But I may dip into parts of it to see what I'm doing wrong!

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** MLOps is the new black. Learn how to pull it off here!

## 4. Tools to make things happen at the right time in the right order

![Tools to make things happen at the right time in the right order](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_20/1024px-Drag_Race_-_2019241185431_2019-08-29_Werner_Rennen_-_1281_-_AK8I8316.jpeg)

Making things happen at the right time in the right order is much harder than it ought to be. Dagster is the latest attempt to make it easier.

A DAG is a Directed Acyclic Graph, a fancy name for a sequence of tasks that depend on each other. These types of jobs are the bread and butter of MLOps, controlling data pipelines, transformations and prediction jobs.

The current go-to tool for this kind of thing, Airflow,  was first developed by Airbnb. It is a bit tricky to set up and use. Dagster is a replacement. Dagster recently [wrote](https://dagster.io/blog/dagster-airflow) an article about why it's way better than Airflow. Another alternative is Prefect, which also [claims](https://docs.prefect.io/core/getting_started/why-not-airflow.html) to be better than Airflow. I've used Prefect and Airflow, and I preferred Prefect. Maybe Dagster is even better?

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** Better than Airflow. Remember cron? How many task schedulers do we need?

## 5. Google's new, new AI platform - Vertex

![Google's new, new AI platform - Vertex](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_20/Penrose_vertex_figures.png)

Google has launched another new AI platform.

An AI platform is a bunch of systems that allows you to build, deploy and manage machine learning models. 

Google has recently [announced](https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2021/0518/vertex-ai-launches) a new platform called Vertex, it replaces the old [AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/docs/technical-overview). The old one allowed you to train, deploy, monitor and manage models. The new one also does that. It also has a [feature store](https://ortom.co.uk/mlops/2021/05/11/item-5-what-the-hell-is-a-feature-store.html). Exciting hey?

It joins a growing list of AI platforms including AWS Sagemaker, Azure ML, Dataiku, Databricks, Datarobot, etc. etc. I guess they can't all succeed. I'm not sure what differentiates each. Can anybody tell me?

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** People really want to sell AI platforms. Do organisations want to buy them?
