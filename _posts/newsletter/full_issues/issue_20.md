## 1. ARGH! AI is going to kill us all!

The dinosaurs got killed off by an asteroid. We'll probably get killed off by ourselves.

There is a burgeoning tradition of prophecies by clever rich white men about the long term dangers of 'super-intelligent' AI. A new [book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B082SXGJYC/) on the topic has now been added by  Oxford philosopher Toby Ord and nicely [reviewed](https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/how-to-think-about-existential-and-immediate-risks-by-daron-acemoglu-2021-05) by Daron Acemoglu.

The idea is like this: We've got power not wisdom, we're developed technology without the wisdom to control it. We should minimise existential risk whatever the cost. The greatest threat is AI. We should focus a large amount of current resources on avoiding there fate of the dinosaurs.

I don't buy it. Worrying about super intelligent AI taking over is (as Andrew Ng said) like worrying about overpopulation on Mars. We're not there yet.

What we should be working about is the impact existing AI + human chimeras and their corporate bodies are doing to the world today. Inequality, environmental damage, misinformation and control are all big present problems that would be more fruitful to focus on. Initiatives such as the EU's proposed AI regulation are likely to have more positive impact than philosophical warbling (much as I enjoy philosophical warbling)

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** AI already runs the world.

## 2. The really open NLP fightback

![The really open NLP fightback](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_20/sid-balachandran-hXttDVCwyRA-unsplash.jpeg)

Large language models are have become the property of big tech firms. Open science is starting to fight back.

Large language models like GPT-3 have show advanced performance across a range of language tasks.  Google have also developed a new system called LaMDA. the ironically named  Open AI to keep models closed. Open AI recently signed an exclusive deal with Microsoft over access to their GPT-3 model.

These models are very effective, but it is difficult for researchers to asses how they perfume with respect to ethical considerations sushi as biases including racism, sexism and abusive ideas.

NLP startup HuggingFace are now [coordinating](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/en/#!index.md) a project to build a set of large multilingual language models that are fully open and available for researchers to study. 

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** Science and software work best when they are open.

## 3. How to learn MLOps

![How to learn MLOps](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_20/tim-mossholder-WE_Kv_ZB1l0-unsplash.jpeg)

Coursera and Andrew Ng have launched a new course on machine learning engineering for production or MLOps.

It is made up of 4 sub-courses. Some topics covered include:

 - Data Pipelines
 - Feature engineering
 - Data labelling
 - Model serving and scaling
 - Model monitoring

I've enjoyed some of prof Ngs other courser courses, so this promises to be good as well. I think the difficulty will be keeping it up to date and also relevant for the google of the world alongside the non-googles of the world. If anybody doe it please let me know what you think.

It varies from person to person, but I know I tend to learn better from doing than a course like this. But I may dip into parts of it to see what I'm doing wrong!

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** MLOps is the new black. Learn how to pull it off here!

## 4. Tools to make things happen at the right time in the right order

![Tools to make things happen at the right time in the right order](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_20/1024px-Drag_Race_-_2019241185431_2019-08-29_Werner_Rennen_-_1281_-_AK8I8316.jpeg)

Making things happen at the right time in the right order is much harder than it ought to be. Dagster is the latest attempt to make it easier.

A DAG is a Directed Acyclic Graph, a fancy name for a sequence of tasks that depend on each other. These types of jobs are the bread and butter of MLOps, controlling data pipelines, transformations and prediction jobs.

The current goto tool for this kind of thing, Airflow,  was first developed by Airbnb. It is a bit tricky to set up and use. Dagster is a replacement. They recently [wrote](https://dagster.io/blog/dagster-airflow) an article about why they're way was better than Airflow. Another alternative is prefect which also [claims](https://docs.prefect.io/core/getting_started/why-not-airflow.html) to be better than Airflow.

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** Better than Airflow. Remember cron?

## 5. Google's new, new AI platform - Vertex

![Google's new, new AI platform - Vertex](https://ortom.co.uk/assets/images/newsletter/issue_20/Penrose_vertex_figures.png)

Google have launch another new AI platform.

An AI platform is a bunch of systems that allow you to build, deploy and manage machine learning models. 

Google have recently [announced](https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2021/0518/vertex-ai-launches) a new platform called Vertex, it replaces the old [AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/docs/technical-overview). The old one allowed you to train, deploy, monitor and manage models. The new one also does that. It also has a [feature store](https://ortom.co.uk/mlops/2021/05/11/item-5-what-the-hell-is-a-feature-store.html). Exciting hey?

It joins a growing list of AI platforms including: AWS Sagemaker, Azure ML, Dataiku, Databricks, Datarobot, etc etc. I guess they can't all succeed. I'm not sure what differentiates each.

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** People really want to sell AI platforms. Do organisations want to buy them?
