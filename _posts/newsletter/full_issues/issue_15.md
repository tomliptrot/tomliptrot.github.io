## 1. What is the protein folding problem?

Last week, Google offshoot Deepmind announced it had effectively solved the "protein folding problem". 

This problem involves predicting the 3D shape of millions of proteins from their chemical structure. It has been an unsolved problem for biologists and computer scientists for decades and solving it one of the most practical and impressive applications of Deepmind's technology to date. This article offers a nice exploration of the problem and explains why solving it is both hard and important.

## 2. Infinite Bad Guy

The best minds of my generation are working out how to make an infinite loop of Billie Eilish cover videos.

More important work form Google here: Billie Eilish cover songs all synced up using recurrent neural networks and an ungodly amount of compute resources. Great stuff.

## 3. Data platforms

What's the difference between a data lake and a data warehouse? An analyst or a scientist?

Recently the Data Driven NYC hosted a conversation between [Tristan Handy](https://twitter.com/jthandy?lang=en), founder & CEO of Fishtown Analytics (which makes DBT, a command line tool for doing data transformations) and [Jeremiah Lowin](https://twitter.com/jlowin), founder & CEO of [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) (which makes an orchestration tool that is a bit like, but supposedly superior to, Airflow). It was an interesting conversation.

Handy on Data Lakes:

> "A data lake is a bunch of files in some particular file format. It can be any one of a large number of formats, including CSV, that is just shoved into an object store. And then you can take a compute engine and run data processing on top of that object store. A data warehouse, ultimately, is the same... the data lake can do anything, but it also probably takes more work to do anything. Whereas the data warehouse has a more constrained set of use cases, but it is much easier to get up and running for those constrained set of use cases."

On data analysts:

>  "a data analyst is somebody who answers business questions with data, and they frequently will have a business or econ degree. And they often have learned all the technologies that are required to do a good job of answering those questions, whether thatâ€™s sometimes Excel, sometimes SQL, sometimes Python or R. But they donâ€™t self-identify as technologists."

## 4. Ethical implications of AI

It can be helpful to categorise AI-driven tasks according to their complexity and ethical implications.

Four types of AI tasks:

- Limited ethical implications and routine (eg. robotic arms)
- Significant ethical implications and routine (eg. robots to help the elderly)
- Limited ethical implications and creative (eg. financial tools)
- Significant ethical implications and creative (eg. autonomous vehicles)

Typically of the Harvard Business Review, the entire world is reduced to 2x2 quadrant plots. Sometimes, though, these can provide useful ways of seeing things. Worth a read.

## 5. What about this idea of rapid antigen testing?

Recently the UK government tried testing everybody in Liverpool for Covid-19. Some of this testing was done using fast turnaround radio antigen tests.

An interesting discussion from Andrew Gelman: according to some people, mass antigen testing is obviously a good thing. If, however, it is so clearly good, why isn't it being done more widely already?

The answer hinges on small differences in sensitivity and specificity that will massively effect the number of false positives and false negatives. All of the science here is new and rapidly evolving and even the reference test (PCR) has a fairly low sensitivity, depending on which paper you read.

Gelman concludes:

> "So, again, Iâ€™m not sure what to think. Iâ€™d think that even a crappy test if applied widely enough would be better than the current setting in which people use more accurate tests but then have to wait many days for the results. Especially if the alternative is some mix of lots of people not going to work and to school and other people, who do have to go to work, being at risk."
