title: New EU AI laws
word_count: '0'

The European Union have published a proposal for a new set of laws regulating the use of artificial intelligence.

The [proposals](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-european-approach-artificial-intelligence) define levels of risk for various applications of this technology.  The highest level of risk ("unnaceptable-risk")includes social scoring by governments, exploitation of vulnerabilities of children, use of subliminal techniques, and reote biometric identification. Under the proposals, these applications of AI would be banned. 

The next level down (High risk) , which would be heavily regulated, includes specific uses in education, recruitment, law enforcement and border control. Regulations of this would cover ethics, data quality, documentation, transparency and accuracy.  At this stage details are fairly sparse.

I welcome the proposals and for the most part they seem appropriate and much needed. However, I expect debate over this to rage for the next decade. The technology is rapidly developing and regulations will struggle to keep up. 

**Why this matters:** On regulation, where the EU leads, other tend to follow. It's early days, expect this to run and run.
