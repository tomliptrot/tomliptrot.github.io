Should the first step in a machine learning project should be to build a production system?

Deploying early solves a multitude of problems [according](https://www.bodyworkml.com/posts/scikit-learn-meet-production) to Bodywork ML. It forces you to think about and solve deployment issues early and encourages best practices at a stage when they are easy to implement.

This sort of approach (described as the Tracer Bullet approach in the excellent [Pragmatic Progammer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-Andrew-Hunt/dp/020161622X) book ) is popular in agile programming and allows iterative improvement to a basic system.

I like the thinking behind this approach, but must say I don't always follow it. I tend to find that I need a different mindset for MLOps vs data exploration. Building a production system given a limited understanding of the data and problem domain can lock you in to an initial conception of the problem. I like to keep initial data exploration and model building as lightweight as possible until I really understand both the data and solution. However, getting something deployed and tested in reality early is certainly a good idea.

**Why this matters:** Model deployment can be tricky, think about it upfront can make things easier later.
