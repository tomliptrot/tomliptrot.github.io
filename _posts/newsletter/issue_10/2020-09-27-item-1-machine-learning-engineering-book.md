A new book has been published about using machine learning at scale in production. 

Machine Learning Engineering by Andriy Burkov, is a complete guide to building testing, deploying and maintaining machine learning models real world settings. Very kindly the book is “read first, buy later”. I'm currently working my way though it but so far have been really impressed. This is a rapidly evening field and on that has yet to establish many best practices or starboard approaches. 

Rather than focusing on specific algorithms or packages, it's all about  ways of solving problems. It also includes practical code snippets in both R and Python.
