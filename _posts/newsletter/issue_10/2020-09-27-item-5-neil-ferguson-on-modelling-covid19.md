title: Neil Ferguson on modelling Covid-19
word_count: null
---

Prof Neil Ferguson ('professor lockdown') gives an overview of his life in science. 

Understandably it focuses on his involvement in modelling Covid-19. It's a really interesting interview giving insights into how decisions were made. How the SAGE meetings worked. He's very sure of himself, and it is clear why he has been so influential. He has some regret about inviting his girlfriend over during lockdown - but is pretty punchy.

He has a couple of interesting insights into new research on the virus. Specifically: 

- People who are asymptotic are not at all infectious.  
- Immunity is not permanent - last few months and decays away.

Decisions are tradeoffs between saving lives and saving jobs - he's glad he doesn't have to make these decisions. So am I!
