title: Neil Ferguson on modelling Covid-19
word_count: null

Prof Neil Ferguson ('Professor Lockdown') gives an overview of his life in science. 

Understandably it focuses on his involvement in modelling Covid-19. It's a really interesting interview, giving insights into how decisions were made and how the SAGE meetings work. He's very sure of himself, and it is clear why he has been so influential. He has some regret about inviting his girlfriend over during lockdown - but not much.

He has a couple of interesting insights into new research on the virus. Specifically: 

- People who are fully asymptotic are not at all infectious.  
- Immunity is not permanent - it lasts few months and decays away.

Worth a listen to hear from a central figure in the Covid crisis give his take on events and 'the science'.
