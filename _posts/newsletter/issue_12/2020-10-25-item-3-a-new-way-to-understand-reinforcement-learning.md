Reinforcement learning can be considered a type of supervised learning.

Reinforcement learning is an approach to machine learning that has bee hugely successful in limited domains. Famously it has been used by deep mind to build algorithms that gain achieve superhuman performance in the games of Go, Chess and various computer games. It does this by playing milions of games against itself and making small changes to improve performance.

However, it has tended to have less practical usage than supervised learning (learning from labelled examples).

This article gives a new way of undertaking RL as supervised ML. I need to read this slowly.
