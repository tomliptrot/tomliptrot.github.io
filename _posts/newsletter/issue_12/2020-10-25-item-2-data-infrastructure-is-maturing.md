title: Data infrastructure is maturing

As machine learning becomes a key part of business, the infrastructure that supports it is maturing.

Lots of companies have some sort of data infrastructure.

> "Data infrastructure serves two purposes at a high level: to help business leaders make better decisions through the use of data (analytic use cases) and to build data intelligence into customer-facing applications, including via machine learning (operational use cases).\"

Broadly, the analytics use case is entered around a data warehouse, and the operational approach tends to focus on a data lake. These is some convergence between these, as data lakes become more structured. (Data reservoirs maybe?)

This article gives three useful blueprints for data architectures::

- MODERN BI (cloud based data warehouse+ visualisation tools - suitable for most companies)
- MULTIMODAL DATA PROCESSING (big enterprises or tech firms with complex needs. Uses all the tools.)
- AI/ML (the least mature and most difficult to get right, many companies build their own. Lots of open source projects. Many don't need this.)
