A new book on  modelling the tidy way in R has been published.

I love R. Even though I mostly use Python lately.

I still love R and have used it for years.

But. It struggles with Machine Learning. 

And the statistical modelling approaches all have different APIs split over many packages. 

The tidyverse and dplyr are great and their AIS are well though out and consitent.

Enter Tidy Models.

A unified approach to modelling that is tidy and has a consistent API. 

Great stuff. I've been watching the development of these packages for. Whole and it looks like they have matured a lot. Really good work from Max Khun.
