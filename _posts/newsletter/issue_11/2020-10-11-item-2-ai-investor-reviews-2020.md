It's been a funny old year so far, and apparently it's already time to start doing roundups. Last week VC Matt Turk produced his review of AI and data in 2020.

There are some some interesting findings. He claims data infrastructure is getting more mature. I think this only holds for BI and 'analytics' data. At the innovation coal face thing are very much in flux. Generally open source rules (I think). There is some useful stuff on orchestration engines I will have a look at ([Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/) [Dagster](https://docs.dagster.io/), [Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/01_introduction/01_introduction.html).)

NLP is big. Transformers all the way. Watch this space.

ML in production in enterprise is happening and maturing. I like this quote: 

> Just like “Big Data” before it, ML/AI, at least in its current form, **will disappear as a noteworthy and differentiating concept, because it will be everywhere**.
