Google has launched another new AI platform.

An AI platform is a bunch of systems that allows you to build, deploy and manage machine learning models. 

Google has recently [announced](https://cloud.google.com/press-releases/2021/0518/vertex-ai-launches) a new platform called Vertex, it replaces the old [AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/docs/technical-overview). The old one allowed you to train, deploy, monitor and manage models. The new one also does that. It also has a [feature store](https://ortom.co.uk/mlops/2021/05/11/item-5-what-the-hell-is-a-feature-store.html). Exciting hey?

It joins a growing list of AI platforms including AWS Sagemaker, Azure ML, Dataiku, Databricks, Datarobot, etc. etc. I guess they can't all succeed. I'm not sure what differentiates each. Can anybody tell me?

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** People really want to sell AI platforms. Do organisations want to buy them?
