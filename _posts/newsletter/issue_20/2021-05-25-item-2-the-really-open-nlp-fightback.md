Large language models are have become the property of big tech firms. Open science is starting to fight back.

Large language models like GPT-3 have show advanced performance across a range of language tasks.  Google have also developed a new system called LaMDA. the ironically named  Open AI to keep models closed. Open AI recently signed an exclusive deal with Microsoft over access to their GPT-3 model.

These models are very effective, but it is difficult for researchers to asses how they perfume with respect to ethical considerations sushi as biases including racism, sexism and abusive ideas.

NLP startup HuggingFace are now [coordinating](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/en/#!index.md) a project to build a set of large multilingual language models that are fully open and available for researchers to study. 

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** Science and software work best when they are open.
