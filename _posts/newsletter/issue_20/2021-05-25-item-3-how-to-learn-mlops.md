Coursera and Andrew Ng have launched a new course on machine learning engineering for production or MLOps.

It is made up of 4 sub-courses. Some topics covered include:

 - Data Pipelines
 - Feature engineering
 - Data labelling
 - Model serving and scaling
 - Model monitoring

I've enjoyed some of prof Ngs other courser courses, so this promises to be good as well. I think the difficulty will be keeping it up to date and also relevant for the google of the world alongside the non-googles of the world. If anybody doe it please let me know what you think.

It varies from person to person, but I know I tend to learn better from doing than a course like this. But I may dip into parts of it to see what I'm doing wrong!

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** MLOps is the new black. Learn how to pull it off here!
