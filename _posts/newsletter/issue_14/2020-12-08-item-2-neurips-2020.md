NeurIPS Thirty-fourth Annual *Conference* on *Neural Information Processing System* takes place next week. This year you can get a ticket (virtually).

Over the last few years NeurIPS has become the hottest academic conference on the planet. In 2018 all of the ticket sold out in 10 minutes and after that they started giving out tickets using a lottery. It features all of the latest and greatest research and application of machine learning and AI.

This year, due to Covid, the conference is taking place virtually and anybody can go (if you want to spend Â£100 to watch videos/ go on zoom). The conference will use [Gather Town](https://gather.town/) and various other innovations to allow some way for people to meet each other.  I'm going to give it a go. Maybe I'll see you in the 'virtual poster session!' and have a 'virtual awkward exchange'.
