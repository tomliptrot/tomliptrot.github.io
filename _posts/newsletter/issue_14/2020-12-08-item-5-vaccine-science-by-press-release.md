AstraZeneca kind of messed up their virus announcement. 

It got one of either 62%, 90% or 70% efficacy. They made a mistake with the dosing of a small number of trial participants and then found that there was a better result in that group. Generally with clinical trials a protocol is pre-regsitred and results are reported against that. Any 'findings' outside of that protocol should be taken with a large pinch of salt. 

AZ only registered one dosage regimen.  Th problem with they type of subgroup analysis that they have done here is that there are many way it can result in spurious results. If you analyse enough subgroups eventually you will fins one where the drug worked better just due to chance. This is OK, and you can control for this, but the results are only valid once they have been confimenbrf thought further trials.

Maybe we shouldn't do science by press release.
