Do you have loads of old lego? Worry no more!

[Brickit](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/brickit) is a new app (for iOS only) that allows you to point your camera at and old pike of Lego bricks. It will identify a what types of bricks you have and suggest models you can build based on this. The brick identification uses machine learning to identify and classify each brick.
