title: Where's my self driving car!?
word_count: '23'

Over the last decade we have been promised self driving cars 'soon' - what's going on?

AI pioneer Andrej Karpathy, Director of AI at Tesla gives a fascinating [talk](https://youtu.be/g6bOwQdCJrc) at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. Updating us on where they are. It has some interesting titbits:

‚û° Using vision to predict depth and velocity. No need for RADAR or detailed 3d maps.

‚û° Collecting real data from Tesla fleet, labelling very well and carefully.

‚û° Auto labelling as a good source of data. Using complex models with low latency to build training data from lighter, more specialist models

‚û° Separate networks for each type of output - detection, attributes, kinematics, trajectory etc.

‚û° Nice release and validation process. Unit tests, shadow modes.

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** An interesting look behind the scenes at Tesla, but full autonomy is still just over the horizon...
