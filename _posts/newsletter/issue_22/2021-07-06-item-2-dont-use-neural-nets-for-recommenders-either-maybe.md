Recommender systems are used extensively by online businesses. Systems using neural networks may not be as effective as advertised

Over the last 4-5 years deep learning has become a popular technique in recommender systems. Recent [research](https://thedataexchange.media/questioning-the-efficacy-of-neural-recommendation-systems) conducted by [Paolo Cremonesi](https://paolocremonesi.faculty.polimi.it/) is  and [Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema](https://mauriziofd.github.io/) has found that many pulsed findings are difficult to replicate and tend not to prove significant improvement over simpler methods like K-nearest neighbours.

The difficulty in reproducing research is a broad problem faced across since. Another problem for recommender systems is that there is not a single, large data set like Imagenet that is used by all researchers. Lots of published results use deep learning, but it is not the best for performance - at least some of the reason for this is that deep-learning is 'trendy' and more likely to get accepted by journals and conferences.

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** Unfortunately, we should take all published research with a pinch of salt. Beware fashions!
