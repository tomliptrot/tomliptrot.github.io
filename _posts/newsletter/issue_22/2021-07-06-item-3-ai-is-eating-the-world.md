Is a future coming where AI will write the code that will build new AI that will build new AI? Maybe...

Github, the leading version control hosting site (owned by Microsoft) has released a new [tool](https://copilot.github.com/) that has been built with the AI research company OpenAI. You enter a small amount of code, or even a description of what you want, and the tool fills in the rest. Examples shown are pretty impressive.

The tool is built using the same types of language model behind GPT-3 and BERT, and they have been trained on millions of lines of open source code. It is not perfect and we don't all have to worry about our jobs just yet, but it is only a matter of time.

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** First application by Microsoft of their collaboration with OpenAI. Beginning of the end for software developers?
