Personalisation and recommendation are one of the most most effective applications of machine learning. 

They allow businesses to tailor products and services to individuals based on a combination of user behaviours and item features. Eugene Yan has written a useful [review](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/patterns-for-personalization/) of some of the main approaches. He splits them into 5 groups:

‚û° Embeddings + MLP: A good simple starting point

‚û° Bandits: A way to balance exploration and exploitation

‚û° Sequential: If you've got long user histories

‚û° Graphs: Not much behaviour data but lots of item/user metadata

‚û° User models: Generic embedding for multiple problems

üõéÔ∏è **Why this matters:** There have been a lot of developments in this field: here is a really useful map.
